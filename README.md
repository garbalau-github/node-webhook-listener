### Description


The term "webhook" is derived from the concept of a "hook" in programming, combined with the web context in which it operates. In programming, a hook is a technique that allows for customizing or extending the functionality of a system by intercepting or "hooking into" events or processes. Similarly, a webhook allows an application to hook into events happening in another application or service over the web.

When an event occurs, the source application makes an HTTP request to a URL configured by the receiving application. This mechanism is akin to setting a virtual "hook" into an event, where the hook catches specific events and then uses web protocols (HTTP) to communicate those events to another system. Thus, the name "webhook" succinctly describes this process of catching and conveying information between web applications in real-time based on events, using hooks that operate over the web.
